A manual apworld for [Rayman Redemption](https://gamejolt.com/games/raymanredemption/340532)!

Your main goal is to retrieve the Great Protoon from the evil Mr. Dark! There's two other goals if you're aiming for a harder challenge:
- Escape with the Great Protoon!
- Complete the True Boss Rush!
- Ultimate Completionist (100% Achievements)

The apworld expects the player to have a save file with all the levels pre-unlocked. This can be done by entering the `19941995` cheat.

World progression is locked by world access items and medallions, medallions are required to access The Final Showdown. Each level's logic is based on what items are needed for said cages/tokens/giftboxes and proceeding throughout the later sections of a level, so if you can't get past a pit because you need pink rings then the rest of the level's logic will require the pink rings.
